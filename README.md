# RSNA Pneumonia Detection Challenge
## A Kaggle competition
This project is an attempt to solve the Pneumonia Detection Challenge by RSNA on Kaggle. For more details, check the official competition page - [RSNA Pneumonia Detection Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rsna-pneumonia-detection-challenge)

## Description
The goal is to detect regions of <b>chest radiograph</b> images that could suggest visual signal for pneumonia.

## Course of action
The task sounds very similar to object detection so the first approach could be using/implementing a State of the Art object detection algorithm, for example YOLO.
